# Higher-Order Component (HOC) Demo

## Description

HOC is a project that demonstrates the use of Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and explores various advanced features in React. The project serves as a learning resource for React developers who want to improve their understanding of HOCs and dive into more complex React functionalities.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase how HOCs can be utilized to enhance component functionality, promote code reusability, and separate cross-cutting concerns like authentication, error handling, and other advanced use cases.

## Features

- Higher-Order Components (HOCs): Explore different HOC patterns and how they can be used to extend component behavior and encapsulate common logic.
- Authentication HOC: Implement a HOC that handles authentication, protecting certain components from unauthorized access.
- Error Handling HOC: Create a HOC that catches errors occurring within components, displaying informative fallback UIs to users.
